  ItemName: Oud
  ItemDescription: "The oud becomes a haunting symbol of the father\u2019s warmth
    and the harmony he brought to the family, silenced forever by betrayal. The broken
    strings of an oud could represent his untimely death and the disconnection from
    his loved ones, leaving behind a legacy of kindness that resonates even after
    his demise."
