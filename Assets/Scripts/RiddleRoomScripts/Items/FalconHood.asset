  ItemName: Falcon's Hood
  ItemDescription: "The falcon\u2019s hood symbolizes Nasser's search for clarity
    and understanding,  like a falcon waiting for its hood to be lifted to see clearly
    and take flight. The hood represents his restrained perspective and his bravery
    in uncovering the truth about his family\u2019s tragic fate."
